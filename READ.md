# AWS Scalable Web Infrastructure (3-Tier Architecture)

This project simulates a highly available and scalable 3-tier web application infrastructure on AWS. It demonstrates best practices in cloud architecture design, automation, and resilience ‚Äî making it an ideal showcase for Solutions Architect roles.

---

## üìå Project Overview

This project implements a production-ready infrastructure including:

- **Web Layer**: Auto Scaling Group of EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB)
- **Application Layer**: EC2 or Lambda functions handling business logic
- **Database Layer**: Amazon RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL) in Multi-AZ for high availability

Additional components include:

- Amazon Route 53 for DNS routing  
- AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and alerts  
- IAM roles with least-privilege access  
- S3 for static content or backups  
- VPC with public/private subnets across multiple Availability Zones  
- NAT Gateway for secure outbound internet access from private subnets  
- Infrastructure-as-Code via AWS CloudFormation or Terraform (optional)

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Demonstrate architectural best practices for scalable and fault-tolerant systems
- Gain hands-on experience designing multi-tier applications on AWS
- Showcase infrastructure planning skills and AWS resource orchestration
- Prepare for real-world Solutions Architect responsibilities
